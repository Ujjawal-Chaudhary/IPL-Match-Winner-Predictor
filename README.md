IPL Match Winner Predictor is a Python project that uses Logistic Regression to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on historical data.This project includes model
training, prediction capabilities, and a web app for user interaction.

FEATURES:
Predict Match Outcomes: Predicts the winner of upcoming IPL matches based on historical match data.
Logistic Regression Model: Utilizes Logistic Regression for making predictions.
Model Persistence: Saves and loads the model using pickle.
Web App Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface using streamlit for making predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing the Logistic Regression model.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
Streamlit: For creating the web app interface.
